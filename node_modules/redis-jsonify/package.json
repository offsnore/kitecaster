  "readme": "node-redis-jsonify\n==================\n\nSave JSON representation of objects to redis when using node_redis\n\nwhy\n------\n\nI basically always save JSON objects to redis. As far as I can tell there isn't \na way to make @mranney's [node_redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis) \nimplicitly convert objects and arrays to JSON before they are sent off to redis.\nSo I would always to have to wrap my set and get calls with JSON.parse/stringify\nnonsense. \n\nhow\n------\n\nThis module exports a function which when passed a RedisClient instance will \nproxy the send_command method and convert anything that is not a Buffer to and \nfrom JSON. I considered modifying the RedisClient prototype automatically when \nthis module is included in your project, but decided against it because you may\nnot want this behavior on all of your redis clients.\n\ninstall\n---------\n\nwith npm...\n\n```bash\nnpm install redis-jsonify\n```\n\nor with git...\n\n```bash\ngit clone git://github.com/wankdanker/node-redis-jsonify.git\n```\n\nexample\n------------\n\n```javascript\n\nvar redis = require('redis')\n\t, jsonify = require('redis-jsonify')\n\t, client = jsonify(redis.createClient())\n\t;\n\nclient.set('asdf', { foo : \"bar\" }, function (err, result) {\n\t\tclient.get('asdf', function (err, result) {\n\t\t\tconsole.log(result); \n\t\t\t// should be { foo : \"bar\" } and not [Object object]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tclient.quit(function () {\t});\n\t\t});\n});\n\n```\n\nextras\n--------\n\nI'm not a huge redis buff yet, so there may be certain commands for which this \nis not a good idea. One example would be the `list` command. The value returned\nby the `list` command is not JSON. To disable the JSON processing for certain\ncommands there is a command blacklist array exported by the module. It currently\nonly contains the `list` command. If you know of other commands that should be\nblacklisted by default or there should be special processing, let me know and\nI'll add them. Pull requests welcome also.\n\n```javascript\nvar jsonify = require('redis-jsonify');\n\n//add somecommand to the blacklist\njsonify.blacklist.push('somecommand');\n\n//dump the blacklist to console\nconsole.log(jsonify.blacklist);\n```\n\nlicense\n----------\n\n### The MIT License (MIT)\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Daniel L.
